		Information we have disclosed or sold for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months, and the
		categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information. We have provided these disclosures in the prior
		sections of this policy. Additionally, in the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of
		Personal Information for business purposes to the following categories of recipients:<br><br>

		<b>Category of Personal Information:</b> Identifiers, such as your first name, last name, phone number, email address, and
		mailing address.<br><br>
		
		<b>Category of Personal Information:</b> Categories of personal information described in subdivision (e) of Section 1798.80
		of the California Civil Code, such as name, address, and telephone number.<br><br>

		internet service providers, email service providers, customer communication service providers.<br><br>

		<b>Category of Personal Information:</b> Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as the type of
		browser you use, app version, access dates and times, pages viewed, and the page you visited before navigating to
		our Sites.<br><br>

		The CCPA also requires us to communicate information about rights California consumers have to request access to
		their Personal Information, to request deletion of their Personal Information, to request additional details about
		our information practices, to request to opt out of the “sale” of their Personal Information, if applicable, and to
		not be discriminated against for exercising such rights.<br><br>

		Your options in regard to the Personal Information we collect about you are described below. You may designate an
		authorized agent to exercise these options on your behalf by providing your authorized agent with written permission
		to act on your behalf and by verifying your own identity with us. Alternatively, you may provide a power of attorney
		pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information
		related to your interactions with us, such as by confirming your email address and/or your state of residence. In
		some cases, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued ID.<br><br>

		<b>Access:</b> As a California resident, you may request access to your Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or
		sell and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you, subject to specified exceptions.
		You may also request additional details about our information practices, including the categories of the Personal
		Information we collected, the sources of collection, categories of Personal Information we share for a business or
		commercial purpose, and the categories of third parties we share your information with. You may request access by
		calling us at _______ or by visiting the page: __________________. You must provide your First and Last Name, email
		address, and phone number used with our services in order for us to match you within our systems, as well as certify

		inaccurate. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct your personal information upon receiving a
		verifiable request from you to correct.<br><br>

		<b>Nondiscrimination:</b> The CCPA prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers for exercising their
		CCPA rights. For example, a business may not charge a different price, deny goods or services, or impose penalties
		on a consumer who exercises their rights under the CCPA. However, a business may charge consumers a different price
		or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer when that difference is

		providing services to you, this disclosure may be considered a sale under California law. In the preceding 12
		months, we have “sold” the following categories of personal information to the following categories of third
		parties:<br><br>

		<b>Do Not Sell My Info:</b> As described above, we may provide Personal Information for the purpose of connecting you with
		Participating Providers to discuss services that you may be interested in for yourself or for others. We give you
		the option to opt out of such sharing at any time by following the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link. The
