		Any dispute arising from the Site and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in
		accordance with the law of the state of Maryland, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard
		to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the

		arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Maryland and
		the United States, respectively, sitting in Baltimore County, Maryland.<br /><br />

		<h3>Claims Subject to Mandatory and Binding Arbitration, Class Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver.</h3>

		Please read the following important section carefully. Except for small claims disputes or claims related to
		intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related
		to the Sites or Services resolved in court. Instead, disputes relating in any way to the Sites or Services must be
		submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply
		to this agreement. The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are
		hereby incorporated by reference.<br /><br />

		You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the Sites or our Services is personal to you and us
		and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class
		arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.<br /><br />

		You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you
		are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay
		all JAMS fees and costs. You have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area.<br /><br />

		You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this
		section by sending an email to ________________. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full
		name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding
		arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the section, “Governing Law and Forum
		Selection”.<br /><br />

		If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or
		unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful
		provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel
		arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any
		claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
		litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation
		of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of
		this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no
		effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will
		be enforceable.<br /><br />

		<h3>General Terms.</h3>

		If any part of the Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the
		invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
		matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use will continue in effect. You may
		not assign the Terms of Use, or assign, transfer, or sublicense your rights, if any, in the Sites. Except as
		expressly stated herein, the Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Cheapmovingservices.com with respect to
		the Sites.<br /><br />
